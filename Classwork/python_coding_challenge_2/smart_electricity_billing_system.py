# Smart Electricity Billing System 
# Problem Statement 
# Monthly electricity consumption (units) of different houses in a residential society is stored as follows: 
# Sample Data 
# units = { 
#     "House101": 320, 
#     "House102": 180, 
#     "House103": 510, 
#     "House104": 275, 
#     "House105": 150, 
#     "House106": 430, 
#     "House107": 220, 
#     "House108": 390, 
#     "House109": 145, 
#     "House110": 600 
# } 
# Tasks 
# 1. Display houses consuming more than 400 units.  
# 2. Find the highest-consuming house.  
# 3. Find the lowest-consuming house.  
# 4. Calculate the total units consumed.  
# 5. Create separate lists for:  
# o Low Consumption (< 200)  
# o Medium Consumption (200–400)  
# o High Consumption (> 400)  
# 6. Count houses eligible for an energy-saving campaign (consumption > 300).  
# Sample Output 
# Houses Consuming More Than 400 Units: 
# House103 
# House106 
# House110 
 
# Highest Consumption: 
# House110 (600 units) 
 
# Lowest Consumption: 
# House109 (145 units) 
 
# Total Units Consumed: 3220 
 
# Low Consumption: 
# ['House102', 'House105', 'House109'] 
 
# Medium Consumption: 
# ['House101', 'House104', 'House107', 'House108'] 
 
# High Consumption: 
# ['House103', 'House106', 'House110'] 
 
# Eligible for Energy-Saving Campaign: 5
