# Task 1: Count Present and Absent Employees
# --------------------------------------------------

# Open file in read mode
file = open("attendance.txt", "r")

present_count = 0
absent_count = 0

# List to store absent employee IDs
absent_employees = []

# Traverse attendance records
for record in file:

    # Remove newline character
    record = record.strip()

    # Split employee ID and status
    emp_id, status = record.split(",")

    # Count present employees
    if status == "P":
        present_count += 1

    # Count absent employees
    else:
        absent_count += 1
        absent_employees.append(emp_id)

# Close file
file.close()

print("Present Employees:", present_count)

# --------------------------------------------------
# Task 2: Display Absent Employee IDs
# --------------------------------------------------

print("\nAbsent Employee IDs:")

for emp_id in absent_employees:
    print(emp_id)

# --------------------------------------------------
# Task 3: Calculate Attendance Percentage
# --------------------------------------------------

total_employees = present_count + absent_count

attendance_percentage = (present_count / total_employees) * 100

print("\nAttendance Percentage:", attendance_percentage, "%")

# --------------------------------------------------
# Task 4: Generate Absentee Report
# --------------------------------------------------

# Open report file in write mode
report_file = open("absent_report.txt", "w")

# Write absent employee IDs
for emp_id in absent_employees:
    report_file.write(emp_id + "\n")

# Close report file
report_file.close()

print("\nAbsentee Report Generated Successfully.")

# --------------------------------------------------
# Task 5: Display Employees Eligible for Attendance Awards
# --------------------------------------------------

print("\nAttendance Award Eligibility:")

# Since attendance file contains only one day's record,
# no employee can be confirmed for 100% attendance.
print("Not Applicable")
